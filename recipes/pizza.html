            <li>25g Sugar</li>
            <li>10g Yeast</li>
            <li>6Tbsp Olive Oil</li>

            <li>Grated Pizza Cheese</li>
            <li>Salami</li>
            <li>Pizza Sauce</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>First add your water to a large bowl and mix in the sugar and the yeast, until it disolves. Let it rest for about 10 minutes or until you see bubbles form on the surface of the water mixture (this means the yeast has succesfully activated.</li>
            <li>In another bowl, prepare your flour and salt, then add it into the water mixture.</li>
            <li>Before mixing it, add your olive oil. The olive oil is essential in this recipe, because it's what makes the end result so soft and perfect.</li>
            <li>Now mix everything together with either your hands, or a mixer, or whatever you prefer. Small tip: once almost done, lay the dough onto a flat surface and knead it until soft.</li>
            <li>Now seperate into as many pieces as you wish (4 is perfect for 4 nicely thick medium pizzas)and roll into balls.</li>
            <li>Cover the balls with a cloth or anything holeless, and let it sit and rise for one hour.</li>
            <li>Now roll the dough until it is the form and size you want, add your pizza sauce, then mix the two cheeses evenly and add them aswell, and then last but not least, add the salami.</li>
            <li>Bake at 190 degrees celcius for 21 minutes.</li>
        </ol>
